# Vagga completion

This is a little autocompletion script for [http://github.com/tailhook/vagga](vagga) project. Currently, it doesn't know much, but I will work on it more, and make it know much more ;-)

### How to use it?

Just clone it and add to you `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`, if you are using zsh) this string and then reload your shell (`source ~/.<shell>rc`)
```bash
    source <path-to-repo>/vagga-completion
```
For example, if you cloned this into folder `projects` of your home directory, the path is `/home/user/projects/vagga-completion/vagga-completion`.

### What it can complete?

Not much at this moment. At this moment, it can only help you to type command name, and no more...
I'm working on making it better :-) Check the TODO.md (when it will be here, if you want to help)
