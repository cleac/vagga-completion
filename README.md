# Vagga completion

This is a little autocompletion script for [http://github.com/tailhook/vagga](vagga) project. Currently, it doesn't know much, but I will work on it more, and make it know much more ;-)

### How to use it

Just clone it and add to you `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`, if you are using zsh) this string 
```bash
    source <path-to-repo>/vagga-completion
```
